// Given a procurement's local state + chain phase snapshot, determines:
//   - What is the current situation?
//   - What is the next legal action?
//   - What is blocking us (if anything)?
//   - Is fallback promotion possible?
//   - Should we transition into linked job execution?
//
// SAFETY CONTRACT: Pure logic. No network calls. No signing.
